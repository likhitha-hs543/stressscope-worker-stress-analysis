# 📁 Legacy Documentation

This folder contains **previous versions** of documentation that have been **replaced by consolidated guides**.

## Why These Are Archived

These files represent the **iterative documentation process** during development. They have been:
- ✅ Preserved for historical reference
- ✅ Consolidated into streamlined guides
- ❌ Not maintained going forward
